## Mouse Sensitivity Profile Manager


</div>

### Description

My kids need the sensitivity of the mouse turned down when they use the computer, as they are just learning to use a mouse.

I need it high for more efficient work practice (read fragging in FPS's!)

I have written a quick and dirty mouse profile manager which allows you to set different mouse sensitivies for different users.

When the program loads you&#8217;ll see an icon popup in the task manager. Review the help for setup instructions.

Dunno if that&#8217;s of any use to any of you. If so great!
